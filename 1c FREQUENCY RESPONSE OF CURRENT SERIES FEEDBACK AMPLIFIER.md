### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1 = 0.64KHZ | f1= 0.45KHZ |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2 = 300KHZ | f2 = 400KHZ |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = \)= 299.4KHZ | \( BW = f'h - f'l = \)= 399.55KHZ |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = \) | \( A'{v(mid)} = \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |G0 = 9.40  | G0 = 5.93 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
